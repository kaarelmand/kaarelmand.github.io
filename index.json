Integrated petrographic, mineralogical, elemental, and isotopic features indicate that the studied claystones contain significant components from mafic volcanic ash that was likely associated with the emplacement of the ELIP. Zircons from the claystones yield UPb ages of ~ 262.5~Ma, which predates the subaerial eruptive phase of the ELIP (259.1–260.4~Ma), but is comparable to the J. altudaensis conodont biostratigraphic zone (~ 263~Ma, Middle Capitanian Stage) which is contemporaneous with the emplacement of early-stage Emeishan subaqueous pillow basalts and mafic volcaniclastics.

A paleoweathering crust on basalts of the Kuksha Volcanic Formation in the Paleoproterozoic Imandra-Varzuga Greenstone Belt, northwestern Russia developed between 2.5 and 2.44 Ga, just before the Great Oxidation Event and can potentially shed light on the paleoatmosphere composition and weathering modes of this time. The 3 m-thick Kuksha paleoweathering profile is characterized by Al-phyllosilicate clay minerals that are typical products of strong chemical weathering of igneous rocks. The mineralogy of the uppermost part of Kuksha weathering crust confirms formation under high CO2 partial pressures, consistent with previous estimates of pCO2 exceeding 0.1 atm during that time interval.

The end of the LJE is, conversely, associated with a recovery of anoxic conditions that might have arrested the evolution of complex life for the next billion years. The post-LJE Zaonega Fm. (ZF;  2.0 Ga), an organic matter-rich carbonate-mudstone succession, is a linchpin in the study of Paloeproterozoic redox shifts. Geochemical data from the ZF has often been interpreted as prime evidence for an “O2 crash” (e.g., Scott et al., 2014), despite other authors including the ZF among well-oxygenated LJE-type successions (e.g., Partin et al., 2013). Here, we present trace element analyses from several recent drill cores in the ZF that contain some of the highest Mo, U and Re concentrations reported to date in pre-Neoproterozoic shales (1009 μg g−1; 238 μg g−1; and 516 ng g−1, respectively). These enrichments are most parsimoniously explained through the establishment of an efficient trace metal trap in a highly bio-productive semi-restricted basin that was intermittently, but reliably, connected to a trace metal-rich ocean. Given that U and Re can only accumulate in an oxic water column, these data imply oxic waters overlying continental shelves during the deposition of the ZF and, therefore, undiminished levels of O2 following the LJE. The temporal decoupling between the LJE and the O2 overshoot, in turn, places doubt on our understanding of the mechanisms underlying some of the most profound environmental shifts in the Paleoproterozoic.","tags":null,"title":"Oxygenated oceans persisted after the Lomagundi Event: Evidence from the Zaonega Formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leslie J.

Four intervals record δ34S values that exceed +30‰. We interpret these unusually 34S-enriched sulphides to be a result of limited sulphate diffusion into pore waters due to changes in sedimentation and/or periods of basinal restriction. Additionally, there are four negative δ34S excursions that are interpreted to reflect changes in the open/closed-system behaviour of sulphate reduction or availability of reactive iron.

Extant polyphosphate-metabolizing bacterial communities are known to act as bacterial phosphate-pumps, leading to episodically high dissolved phosphate concentrations in pore waters of organic-rich sediment. These conditions can promote the precipitation of amorphous precursor phases that are quickly converted to apatite—usually in carbonate fluorapatite form [Ca10(PO4,CO3)6F2-3]. To assess the mechanisms underpinning the nucleation and growth of sedimentary apatite, we sampled P-rich sediments from the Namibian shelf, a modern environment where phosphogenesis presently occurs. The P-rich fraction of the topmost centimetres of sediment mainly consists of pellets about 50–400 μm in size, which in turn are comprised of micron-sized apatite particles that are often arranged into radial structures with diameters ranging from 2 to 4 μm, and morphologies that range from rod-shapes to dumbbells to spheres that resemble laboratory-grown fluorapatite–gelatin nanocomposites known from double-diffusion experiments in organic matrices. The nucleation and growth of authigenic apatite on the Namibian shelf is likely analogous to these laboratory-produced precipitates, where organic macromolecules play a central role in apatite nucleation and growth. The high density of apatite nucleation sites within the pellets ($$109 particles per cm3) suggests precipitation at high pore water phosphate concentrations that have been reported from the Namibian shelf and may be attributed to microbial phosphate pumping. The intimate association of organic material with the apatite could suggest a possible role of biological substrata, such as exopolymeric substances (EPS), in the nucleation of apatite precursors. Importantly, we do not observe any evidence that the apatite particles are actual phosphatized microbes, contradicting some earlier studies. Nevertheless, these results further evidence the potential importance of microbially derived (extracellular) organic matter as a template for phosphatic mineral nucleation in both recent and ancient phosphorites.","tags":null,"title":"Authigenesis of biomorphic apatite particles from Benguela Upwelling Zone sediments off Namibia: The role of organic matter in sedimentary apatite nucleation and growth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mänd, K.","Muehlenbachs, K.","McKellar, R.

However, interpretations concerning their environmental context are often hampered by uncertainties in the relationship between assemblages of inclusions and geological context, particularly in the case of secondarily redeposited ambers such as those from the Paleogene of Central Europe. Here we use stable carbon and hydrogen isotope analyses, as well as FTIR spectroscopy, from the northwestern Ukrainian Rovno amber deposit, to provide independent constraints on the geographic and temporal origins of Rovno amber. These analyses address the relationship between the Rovno and Baltic amber deposits as well as German Bitterfeld amber—a subject of considerable debate regarding their provenance. Rovno amber has a δ13C signature of −23.3 ± 0.9‰, similar to both Baltic and Bitterfeld ambers. Since there is a secular decreasing δ13C trend among amber deposits since the Early Eocene, a roughly contemporaneous origin of these deposits in the Eocene can be deduced. However, Rovno amber displays a δ2H signature of −258 ± 9‰, 19‰ more positive than Baltic amber, and directly comparable to Bitterfeld amber. This difference relates to precipitation sources and mean annual temperatures of the amber source regions, and suggests a much more southerly origin of Rovno amber relative to Baltic amber. FTIR spectra of each of these ambers are nearly identical and suggest that resin-producing trees were from similar families, despite contrasting source regions. Thus, we provide the first clear geochemical evidence for the distinct origin of Rovno and Baltic amber deposits, with implications for paleoecological studies involving inclusions from these deposits, and for determining the provenance of archaeological amber finds.","tags":["FTIR","Stable isotope geochemistry","Ukrainian amber","δC","δD","δH"],"title":"Distinct origins for Rovno and Baltic ambers: Evidence from carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mänd, K","Thoby, M.","Lalonde, S.

Following the rise of atmospheric O2 at  2.4 Ga, the  2.3–2.0 Ga Lomagundi positive carbon isotope excursion (LIE) has been suggested to reflect atmospheric O2 approaching modern levels. It has been inferred that the waning stage of the LIE was accompanied by a substantial decline in atmospheric O2. The sparse Paleoproterozoic rock record, however, complicates the interpretation of paleoredox proxies. Redox-sensitive elements (RSE; Mo, V, Re, U, and Cr) are frequently used to infer atmospheric and water column redox conditions. Typically, RSE are concentrated in oxygenated waters and sequestered into anoxic sediments, with their abundances in sedimentary successions governed by the global extent of anoxic sinks at deposition. Compilations of sedimentary rock records have demonstrated variations in RSE abundance with low concentrations in the Archean, increasing in the Paleoproterozoic before declining in the Mesoproterozoic. The  2.0 Ga Zaonega Formation (ZF) in NW-Russia is a well-preserved volcano-sedimentary succession composed of interlayered organic-rich (10-70 wt.%) mudstones, carbonates and magmatic rocks deposited shortly after the termination of the LIE. These organic-rich rocks are key for understanding the architecture of late Paleoproterozoic redox conditions. Here we report RSE enrichment and isotope data from recent upper ZF drill cores. RSE concentrations are among the highest reported for the Precambrian (Mo ≤ 2000 ppm, V ≤ 8000 ppm, Re ≤ 1.5 ppm), implying oxidative continental weathering, a limited extent for seafloor anoxia, and potentially elevated seawater sulphate compared what was previously suggested at  2 Ga.

The size of the marine Mo pool is determined by the extent of sea bottom euxinia and the rate of terrestrial oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals (Robbins et al. 2016). Large-scale studies of the rock record have found an uptick in the Mo concentrations of black shales up to 80 ppm in the Paleoproterozoic, which has been attributed to an increase in oxidative weathering and oxic marine conditions following the rapid rise of oxygen during the Great Oxidation Event (Scott et al. 2008). While the basic principles of Mo cycling are relatively well-understood, the specific mechanisms controlling the removal of Mo into sediments are a subject of much debate, mainly involving the roles of iron oxides and organic matter in providing adsorption sites for Mo. Furthermore, it is not known whether organic matter acts as a shuttle of Mo from the water column to the sediments or whether Mo is preferentially removed below the sediment-water interface (Dahl et al. 2016). Here are presented data on the upper section of the NW Russian Zaonega Fm organic-rich shales, which contain unprecedented Mo concentrations (up to 2000 ppm) for this age. Whole-rock and in-situ measurements of δ98Mo and [Mo] coupled with detailed lithological and geochemical controls allow for a thorough evaluation of the mechanisms controlling the redox-sensitive trace metal budget in Precambrian black shales. The contributions of different Mo transport mechanisms, the role of hydrothermal input, the recrystallization of sulfide species and the input of methanotrophic organic matter are considered, with important implications for global paleoredox models based off of the trace metal systematics of black shales.","tags":null,"title":"Trace metal enrichment in 1.98 Ga black shales of the Zaonega Formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mänd, K.","Bailey, J.

Sulphur bacteria inhabiting modern shelfs act as bacterial “pumps” leading to the phosphate concentrations needed for precipitation of Ca-phosphate minerals such as apatite (Schulz, 2005). Apatite precipitation is highly enhanced in the presence of suitable nucleation templates, such as organic matrices and bacterial ultrastructures. The microstructure of phosphatic grains from modern Namibian shelf sediments was examined using scanning electron microscopy. The grains are composed of mostly pure Ca-phosphate and are highly porous. The pore walls are largely coated with rod-shaped microstructures of around 1μm in length and 0.3μm in diameter which co-occur with an organic matrix. The rods possess consistent shapes and sizes, and are composed of nanocrystallites arranged along the long axis. Superficially, they strongly resemble mineralized microbial cells. However, some morphological features are not consistent with microbial origin. Many of the rods intersect at angles close to 60 or 90 degrees. Together with other microstructures present in the grains, they seem to form a continuum from rods through dumbbells to semispherical. Remarkably similar aggregates, called biomimetic fluoroapatite-gelatine composites, have been described from laboratory experiments at high supersaturation (e.g.Busch 1999). Our findings indicate that precaution must be taken while assessing the microbial origin of authigenic precipitates. Nevertheless, the common association of biomimetic apatite composites with organic matrices is consistent with the influence ofbiological processes on phosphate availability and precipitation.","tags":null,"title":"Origin of rod and dumbbell shaped phosphate precipitates in Namibian shelf sediments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mänd, K.","Bailey, J.

Sulphur bacteria inhabiting modern shelfs act as bacterial “pumps” leading to the increased concentration of phosphate in sediment pore water [1] and the precipitation of the Caphosphate mineral apatite. Apatite precipitation is significantly enhanced in certain environmental conditions, e.g. in the presence of suitable nucleation substrates, such as organic matrices and bacterial ultrastructures [2]. Microstructures of phosphatic grains from modern Namibian shelf sediments were examined using scanning electron microscopy. The grains are mainly composed of massive Ca-phosphate containing some microscale pores in which conspicuous apatitic cylindrical particles were revealed along with framboidal pyrite aggregates. Such particles co-occur with biofilm and measure around 1 μm in length and 0.3 μm in diameter. They possess consistent shapes and sizes and are composed of small nanocrystallites aligned along the long axis. Superficially, they strongly resemble mineralized microbial cells. However, some morphological characteristics are not typical of microbes – many of the particles intersect, usually at angles close to 60 and 45 degrees, which may be the result of recrystallization. However, it is important to note that similar aggregates have been previously described from authigenic calcite and phosphorites [3] as well as in phosphate aggregates produced in laboratory experiments [4] forming at relatively high supersaturation levels. Our findings indicate that precaution must be taken while assessing the microbial origin of authigenic precipitates. Nevertheless, the common association of apatitic particles with organic matrices is consistent with the influence of biological processes on phosphate availability and precipitation.","tags":null,"title":"Apatitic micronodules in Namibian shelf sediments: Mineralized microbes or diagenetic precipitates?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaarel Mänd","Jake V.

Although the record of life on Earth extends back to 3.8 billion years ago and the advent of biological phosphate processing can be tracked to at least 3.5 billion years ago, the earliest known P-rich deposits appeared only 2 billion years ago. The onset of P deposition has been attributed to the rise of atmospheric oxygen 2.4–2.3 billion years ago and the related profound biogeochemical shifts, which increased the riverine input of phosphate to the ocean and boosted biological productivity and phosphogenesis. However, the P-rich deposits post-date the rise of oxygen by about 300 million years. Here we use microfabric, trace element and carbon isotope analyses to assess the environmental setting and redox conditions of the 2-billion-year-old P-rich deposits of the vent- or seep-influenced Zaonega Formation, northwest Russia. We identify phosphatized microorganism fossils that resemble modern methanotrophic archaea and sulphur-oxidizing bacteria, analogous to organisms found in modern seep settings and upwelling zones with a sharp redoxcline. We therefore propose that the P-rich deposits in the Zaonega Formation were formed by phosphogenesis mediated by sulphur bacteria, similar to modern sites, and by the precipitation of calcium phosphate minerals on microbial templates during early diagenesis.","tags":["C: fosfaadid","phosphate","Phosphogenesis","biomineralization","C: Biomineralisatsioon","C: metanotroofid","C: shungiit","C: sügiskool 2014","C: sulfobakterid","metanotrophs","microbes","microfossils","Phosphorite","shungite","sulphur bacteria"],"title":"Potential influence of sulphur bacteria on Palaeoproterozoic phosphogenesis","type":"publication"}]
