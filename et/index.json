Despite having undergone upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies metamorphism, the Dagushan BIF retains evidence of varied depositional facies, making it an ideal archive to evaluate the paleomarine environment and the paragenesis of the ore minerals. A transition from oxide to silicate to carbonate facies BIF is evident in a northward direction. The mineralogical composition shifts from magnetite and quartz in the south through a magnetite-quartz-cummingtonite/stilpnomelane assemblage in the transition zone to magnetite-siderite in the north. Such a distinct distribution of mineralogical facies correlates well with the depositional environment of the BIF. The carbonate facies BIFs formed in a near-shore, proximal environment, whereas the oxide and silicate facies BIF assemblages formed in deeper waters, distal to the paleoshoreline. The BIF samples display characteristic seawater-like rare earth element + yttrium (REE + Y) profiles with positive La and Y anomalies and heavy REE enrichment relative to the light REEs when normalized to post-Archean Australian shale. Positive Eu anomalies suggest a high-temperature hydrothermal contribution to the BIF. The absence of a negative Ce anomaly in nearly all samples, coupled with positive δ56Fe in magnetite in all mineralogical facies, indicates a dominantly anoxic water column contemporaneous with deposition of the BIF. At ~ 2.53 Ga in the Anshan area, seawater was mostly anoxic and rich in ferrous iron. Dissolved ferrous iron in upwelling hydrothermal fluids was oxidized and precipitated as Fe(III) oxyhydroxides in the photic zone leading to BIF formation. Proximal to hydrothermal vents, magnetite formed via the reaction of Fe(III) oxyhydroxides and aqueous Fe(II) supplied from the hydrothermal fluids and microbial dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) coupled to organic carbon oxidation. Proximal to a paleoshoreline, siderite formed through DIR, as evidenced by the depleted δ13C values and the presence of graphite. Silicates, such as stilpnomelane and cummingtonite, are considered to be the metamorphic products of early diagenetic silicates (e.g.,~nontronite) that formed in the water column from admixtures of Fe(III) oxyhydroxides and amorphous silica.","tags":[],"title":"Depositional and environmental constraints on the late Neoarchean Dagushan deposit (Anshan-Benxi area, North China Craton): An Algoma-type banded iron formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Jälgmetallide ja mineraalsete toiteelementide porsumine mandritel, nende transport ookeanidesse ja ladestumine setetes.\n","date":1615487051,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"et","lastmod":1615487051,"objectID":"8de7843b17e7db2309b27d31553b1825","permalink":"https://kaarelmand.github.io/et/project/tracemetalnutrients/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T20:24:11+02:00","relpermalink":"/et/project/tracemetalnutrients/","section":"project","summary":"Jälgmetallide ja mineraalsete toiteelementide porsumine mandritel, nende transport ookeanidesse ja ladestumine setetes.","tags":[],"title":"Jälgmetallide ja toiteelementide geokeemia","type":"project"},{"authors":["Kaarel Mänd"],"categories":["presentation"],"content":"","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"et","lastmod":1616515622,"objectID":"c8a5b2eefbaabc592020e90ba93f41ec","permalink":"https://kaarelmand.github.io/et/publication/mand-2021-originsbiodiversity-did/","publishdate":"2021-03-22T20:43:27.16726Z","relpermalink":"/et/publication/mand-2021-originsbiodiversity-did/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The origins of biodiversity: Did changing oxygen levels in the Proterozoic induce the rise of complex life?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoxue Tong","Kaarel Mänd","Yuhao Li","Lianchang Zhang","Zidong Peng","Qiang Wu","Pengbo Li","Mingguo Zhai","Leslie J.

However, the formation pathways of Fe carbonate, namely siderite, remain disputed. Here, we provide photomicrographs, Fe, C and O isotope of siderite, and organic C isotope of the whole rock from the ~ 2.52 Ga Dagushan BIF in the Anshan area, China, to discuss the origin of siderite. There are small magnetite grains that occur as inclusions within siderite, suggesting a diagenetic origin of the siderite. Moreover, the siderites have a wide range of iron isotope compositions (\u0026delta;56FeSd) from \u0026minus;0.180\u0026permil; to +0.463\u0026permil;, and a relatively negative C isotope composition (\u0026delta;13CSd = \u0026minus;6.20\u0026permil; to \u0026minus;1.57\u0026permil;). These results are compatible with the reduction of an Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide precursor to dissolved Fe(II) through microbial dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) during early diagenesis. Partial reduction of the precursor and possible mixing with seawater Fe(II) could explain the presence of siderite with negative \u0026delta;56Fe, while sustained reaction of residual Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide could have produced siderite with positive \u0026delta;56Fe values. Bicarbonate derived from both DIR and seawater may have provided a C source for siderite formation. Our results suggest that microbial respiration played an important role in the formation of siderite in the late Archean Dagushan BIF.","tags":["banded iron formation","carbon isotopes","dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR)","iron isotopes","North China Craton","siderite"],"title":"Iron and carbon isotope constraints on the formation pathway of iron-rich carbonates within the Dagushan Iron Formation, North China Craton","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaarel Mänd"],"categories":["presentation"],"content":"","date":1601078400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"et","lastmod":1616515622,"objectID":"9f6d25a7b65fdf305ac2e63d1383deab","permalink":"https://kaarelmand.github.io/et/publication/mand-2020-kaotatudparadiisja/","publishdate":"2021-03-22T20:43:27.066756Z","relpermalink":"/et/publication/mand-2020-kaotatudparadiisja/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Kaotatud paradiis ja keeruka elu häll: Hapnik ja päristuumsed 2 miljardit aastat tagasi","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timmu Kreitsmann","Aivo Lepland","Michael Bau","Anthony Prave","Kärt Paiste","Kaarel Mänd","Holar Sepp","Tõnu Martma","Alexander E.

The Formation accumulated shortly after the LJE and encompasses both the recovery in the carbon cycle and hypothesised contraction of the oceanic oxidant pool. However, interpreting the correct environmental context recorded by geochemical signatures in the Zaonega rocks is difficult due to a complex depositional and diagenetic history. In order to robustly constrain that history, we undertook a multiproxy study (mineralogy, petrography, carbon isotope and rare earth element composition) of carbonate beds in the upper part of the Zaonega Formation recovered in the 102-m composite section of the OnZap drill-cores. Our findings differentiate primary environmental signatures from secondary overprinting and show that: (i) the best-preserved carbonate beds define an upwards increasing δ13Ccarb trend from c. -5.4‰ to near 0‰; and that (ii) large intra-bed δ13Ccarb variations reflect varying contributions of methanotrophic dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to the basinal DIC pool. Rare earth element and yttrium (REYSN) patterns confirm a marine origin of the carbonate beds whereas a consistent positive EuSN anomaly suggests a strong high temperature hydrothermal input during accumulation of the Zaonega Formation. Importantly, the presence of a negative CeSN anomaly in the REYSN pattern indicates an oxygenated atmosphere-ocean system shortly after the LJE and indicates that models invoking a fall in oxygen at that time require reassessment.","tags":["carbon isotopes","Ce anomaly","Lomagundi-Jatuli Event","rare earth elements","Zaonega Formation"],"title":"Oxygenated conditions in the aftermath of the Lomagundi-Jatuli Event: The carbon isotope and rare earth element signatures of the Paleoproterozoic Zaonega Formation, Russia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kärt Paiste","Aivo Lepland","Aubrey L.

Efforts to unravel the dynamics of our planet’s early oxygenation from this archive rely on various geochemical proxies, including stable carbon and sulfur isotopes. However, ancient metasedimentary rocks often experienced early- and late-stage (bio)geochemical processes making it difficult to discern primary environmental signals from bulk-rock δ13Corg and δ34S values. Such complexity in carbon and sulfur isotope systematics contributes to uncertainty about the redox structure of Paleoproterozoic oceans. A currently popular idea is that, following the Great Oxidation Event, global changes led to low-oxygen environments and temporally fluctuating ocean redox conditions that lasted until the Neoproterozoic. The volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Onega Basin have figured prominently in this concept, particularly the exceptionally organic-rich rocks of the 1.98 Ga Zaonega Formation. However, a growing body of evidence shows that local depositional processes acted to form the δ13Corg and pyrite δ34S records of the Zaonega Formation, thus calling for careful assessment of the global significance of these isotope records. Placing new and existing organic carbon and sulfur isotope data from the Zaonega Formation into the context of basin history and by comparing those results with key Paleoproterozoic successions of the Francevillian Basin (Gabon), the Pechenga Greenstone Belt (NW Russia) and the Animikie Basin (Canada), we show that the stratigraphic δ13Corg and pyrite δ34S trends can be explained by local perturbations in biogeochemical carbon and sulfur cycling without requiring global drivers. Despite their temporal disparity, we also demonstrate that individual successions share certain geological traits (e.g. magmatic and/or tectonic activity, hydrocarbon generation, basin restriction) suggesting that their pyrite δ34S and δ13Corg trends were governed by common underlying mechanisms (e.g. similar basinal evolution and biogeochemical feedbacks) and are not necessarily unique to certain time intervals. We further show that pyrites in these successions that are most likely to capture ambient seawater sulfate isotopic composition have consistent δ34S values of 15–18‰, which hints at remarkable stability in the marine sulfur cycle over most of the Paleoproterozoic Era.","tags":["Carbon cycle","Great Oxidation Event","Ocean redox","Onega Basin","Paleoproterozoic","Sulfur cycle"],"title":"Identifying global vs. basinal controls on Paleoproterozoic organic carbon and sulfur isotope records","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao Yan","Daohui Pi","Shao-Yong Jiang","Weiduo Hao","Huan Cui","Leslie J.

These anomalous values have been linked to marine anoxia, low sulfate concentrations in seawater, or aerobic re-oxidation of dissolved sulfide within well-oxygenated bottom waters in a local depositional environment. Implicit to these previous models is the assumption of a biogenic genesis from microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) of these pyrites, which, in turn, can be used to understand the biogeochemical sulfur cycle and reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions. In South China, the Late-Devonian bulk-rock sulfur isotope excursion occurs in the lower Fammenian Wuzhishan Formation of the Youjiang Basin, in both the sedimentary limestone that corresponds to the Late triangularis conodont zone at the Fuhe section and the sediment-hosted Xialei Mn deposit that lies between the Late triangularis and crepida conodont zones. To further constrain the significance of these 34S-enriched pyrites, we carried out detailed textural and in-situ sulfur isotope examinations of pyrites in the Xialei Mn deposit. We found one type of pyrite in siliceous limestone referred to as the host rocks and three distinct pyrite types in Mn ores: Type I – pyrites with Mn-carbonate inclusion-rich cores; Type II – pyrite overgrowths surrounding an “inclusion-rich” core; and Type III – relatively inclusion-poor and mainly subhedral disseminated pyrite grains. Type I pyrites in Mn ores have negative δ34Spyrite values from -7.8‰ to -2.0‰. Types II and III pyrites, and pyrites in the host rock are characterized by highly positive δ34Spyrite values (+4.2‰ to +37.6‰), with some values being higher than that of contemporaneous seawater sulfate. Type I pyrites with negative δ34S values likely formed via MSR in a closed porewater system, driven by increased sedimentation rates during a sea level lowstand. The other pyrites with highly positive δ34S values appear to have formed during secondary hydrothermal alteration, with their sulfur sourced through thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) of sulfate from dissolved barites in the underlying Liujiang Formation. This implies that the positive δ34S values of the Late Devonian pyrites from the Wuzhishan Formation represent a later alteration event caused by post-depositional hydrothermal fluids, and may lack a direct biogeochemical connection to the surface sulfur cycle. These results provide an important perspective on the origin of variability in sulfur isotope records and suggest the need for careful petrographic screening and micrometer-scale analysis of sedimentary units used to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions.","tags":["in-situ analysis","Late Devonian","Mn ores","positive sulfur isotopic excursion","pyrite","South China"],"title":"Hydrothermally induced $^{34}$S enrichment in pyrite as an alternative explanation of the Late-Devonian sulfur isotope excursion in South China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao Yan","Dao-Hui Pi","Shao-Yong Jiang","Weiduo Hao","Kaarel Mänd","Leslie J.

Integrated petrographic, mineralogical, elemental, and isotopic features indicate that the studied claystones contain significant components from mafic volcanic ash that was likely associated with the emplacement of the ELIP. Zircons from the claystones yield UPb ages of ~ 262.5~Ma, which predates the subaerial eruptive phase of the ELIP (259.1–260.4~Ma), but is comparable to the J. altudaensis conodont biostratigraphic zone (~ 263~Ma, Middle Capitanian Stage) which is contemporaneous with the emplacement of early-stage Emeishan subaqueous pillow basalts and mafic volcaniclastics.

Major changes in the development of Earth’s geochemical system were taking place at a critical time coinciding with the Archean-Proterozoic transition when Earth’s atmosphere became oxygenated, thus triggering a whole new set of chemical weathering reactions. A paleoweathering crust on basalts of the Kuksha Volcanic Formation in the Paleoproterozoic Imandra-Varzuga Greenstone Belt, northwestern Russia developed between 2.5 and 2.44 Ga, just before the Great Oxidation Event and can potentially shed light on the paleoatmosphere composition and weathering modes of this time. The 3 m-thick Kuksha paleoweathering profile is characterized by Al-phyllosilicate clay minerals that are typical products of strong chemical weathering of igneous rocks. The mineralogy of the uppermost part of Kuksha weathering crust confirms formation under high CO2 partial pressures, consistent with previous estimates of pCO2 exceeding 0.1 atm during that time interval. That is in agreement with the geochemical and mineralogical proxies thereby also suggesting an intense acidic weathering under low-oxygen conditions.","tags":["Acid leaching","Anoxic atmosphere","Archean","Dickite-kaolinite","Kuksha volcanic formation","Paleoproterozoic","Paleoweathering","Siderite"],"title":"High-CO$\\\\_2$, acidic and oxygen-starved weathering at the Fennoscandian Shield at the Archean-Proterozoic transition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaarel Mänd","Leslie J.

The end of the LJE is, conversely, associated with a recovery of anoxic conditions that might have arrested the evolution of complex life for the next billion years. The post-LJE Zaonega Fm. (ZF;  2.0 Ga), an organic matter-rich carbonate-mudstone succession, is a linchpin in the study of Paloeproterozoic redox shifts. Geochemical data from the ZF has often been interpreted as prime evidence for an “O2 crash” (e.g., Scott et al., 2014), despite other authors including the ZF among well-oxygenated LJE-type successions (e.g., Partin et al., 2013). Here, we present trace element analyses from several recent drill cores in the ZF that contain some of the highest Mo, U and Re concentrations reported to date in pre-Neoproterozoic shales (1009 μg g−1; 238 μg g−1; and 516 ng g−1, respectively). These enrichments are most parsimoniously explained through the establishment of an efficient trace metal trap in a highly bio-productive semi-restricted basin that was intermittently, but reliably, connected to a trace metal-rich ocean. Given that U and Re can only accumulate in an oxic water column, these data imply oxic waters overlying continental shelves during the deposition of the ZF and, therefore, undiminished levels of O2 following the LJE. The temporal decoupling between the LJE and the O2 overshoot, in turn, places doubt on our understanding of the mechanisms underlying some of the most profound environmental shifts in the Paleoproterozoic.","tags":[],"title":"Oxygenated oceans persisted after the Lomagundi Event: Evidence from the Zaonega Formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kärt Paiste","Aivo Lepland","Aubrey L.

Extant polyphosphate-metabolizing bacterial communities are known to act as bacterial phosphate-pumps, leading to episodically high dissolved phosphate concentrations in pore waters of organic-rich sediment. These conditions can promote the precipitation of amorphous precursor phases that are quickly converted to apatite—usually in carbonate fluorapatite form [Ca10(PO4,CO3)6F2-3]. To assess the mechanisms underpinning the nucleation and growth of sedimentary apatite, we sampled P-rich sediments from the Namibian shelf, a modern environment where phosphogenesis presently occurs. The P-rich fraction of the topmost centimetres of sediment mainly consists of pellets about 50–400 μm in size, which in turn are comprised of micron-sized apatite particles that are often arranged into radial structures with diameters ranging from 2 to 4 μm, and morphologies that range from rod-shapes to dumbbells to spheres that resemble laboratory-grown fluorapatite–gelatin nanocomposites known from double-diffusion experiments in organic matrices. The nucleation and growth of authigenic apatite on the Namibian shelf is likely analogous to these laboratory-produced precipitates, where organic macromolecules play a central role in apatite nucleation and growth. The high density of apatite nucleation sites within the pellets ($$109 particles per cm3) suggests precipitation at high pore water phosphate concentrations that have been reported from the Namibian shelf and may be attributed to microbial phosphate pumping. The intimate association of organic material with the apatite could suggest a possible role of biological substrata, such as exopolymeric substances (EPS), in the nucleation of apatite precursors. Importantly, we do not observe any evidence that the apatite particles are actual phosphatized microbes, contradicting some earlier studies. Nevertheless, these results further evidence the potential importance of microbially derived (extracellular) organic matter as a template for phosphatic mineral nucleation in both recent and ancient phosphorites.","tags":[],"title":"Authigenesis of biomorphic apatite particles from Benguela Upwelling Zone sediments off Namibia: The role of organic matter in sedimentary apatite nucleation and growth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaarel Mänd","Karlis Muehlenbachs","Ryan C.

However, interpretations concerning their environmental context are often hampered by uncertainties in the relationship between assemblages of inclusions and geological context, particularly in the case of secondarily redeposited ambers such as those from the Paleogene of Central Europe. Here we use stable carbon and hydrogen isotope analyses, as well as FTIR spectroscopy, from the northwestern Ukrainian Rovno amber deposit, to provide independent constraints on the geographic and temporal origins of Rovno amber. These analyses address the relationship between the Rovno and Baltic amber deposits as well as German Bitterfeld amber—a subject of considerable debate regarding their provenance. Rovno amber has a δ13C signature of −23.3 ± 0.9‰, similar to both Baltic and Bitterfeld ambers. Since there is a secular decreasing δ13C trend among amber deposits since the Early Eocene, a roughly contemporaneous origin of these deposits in the Eocene can be deduced. However, Rovno amber displays a δ2H signature of −258 ± 9‰, 19‰ more positive than Baltic amber, and directly comparable to Bitterfeld amber. This difference relates to precipitation sources and mean annual temperatures of the amber source regions, and suggests a much more southerly origin of Rovno amber relative to Baltic amber. FTIR spectra of each of these ambers are nearly identical and suggest that resin-producing trees were from similar families, despite contrasting source regions. Thus, we provide the first clear geochemical evidence for the distinct origin of Rovno and Baltic amber deposits, with implications for paleoecological studies involving inclusions from these deposits, and for determining the provenance of archaeological amber finds.","tags":["FTIR","Stable isotope geochemistry","Ukrainian amber","δC","δD","δH"],"title":"Distinct origins for Rovno and Baltic ambers: Evidence from carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaarel Mänd"],"categories":["presentation"],"content":"","date":1516579200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"et","lastmod":1616515622,"objectID":"f05814cb60df1a038c03c9672f0e8b85","permalink":"https://kaarelmand.github.io/et/publication/mand-2018-highmolybdenumabundance/","publishdate":"2021-03-22T20:43:26.864049Z","relpermalink":"/et/publication/mand-2018-highmolybdenumabundance/","section":"publication","summary":"The Paleoproterozoic era is characterized by fundamental shifts in the redox conditions of Earth’s surface environments. Following the rise of atmospheric O2 at  2.4 Ga, the  2.3–2.0 Ga Lomagundi positive carbon isotope excursion (LIE) has been suggested to reflect atmospheric O2 approaching modern levels [1]. It has been inferred that the waning stage of the LIE was accompanied by a substantial decline in atmospheric O2. The sparse Paleoproterozoic rock record, however, complicates the interpretation of paleoredox proxies. Redox-sensitive elements (RSE; Mo, V, Re, U, and Cr) are frequently used to infer atmospheric and water column redox conditions. Typically, RSE are concentrated in oxygenated waters and sequestered into anoxic sediments, with their abundances in sedimentary successions governed by the global extent of anoxic sinks at deposition. Compilations of sedimentary rock records have demonstrated variations in RSE abundance with low concentrations in the Archean, increasing in the Paleoproterozoic before declining in the Mesoproterozoic [e.g., 2]. The  2.0 Ga Zaonega Formation (ZF) in NW-Russia is a well-preserved volcano-sedimentary succession composed of interlayered organic-rich (10-70 wt.%) mudstones, carbonates and magmatic rocks deposited shortly after the termination of the LIE. These organic-rich rocks are key for understanding the architecture of late Paleoproterozoic redox conditions. Here we report RSE enrichment and isotope data from recent upper ZF drill cores. RSE concentrations are among the highest reported for the Precambrian (Mo ¿ 2000 ppm, V ¿ 8000 ppm, Re ¿ 1.5 ppm), implying oxidative continental weathering, a limited extent for seafloor anoxia, and potentially elevated seawater sulphate compared what was previously suggested at  2 Ga [2].

The size of the marine Mo pool is determined by the extent of sea bottom euxinia and the rate of terrestrial oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals (Robbins et al. 2016). Large-scale studies of the rock record have found an uptick in the Mo concentrations of black shales up to 80 ppm in the Paleoproterozoic, which has been attributed to an increase in oxidative weathering and oxic marine conditions following the rapid rise of oxygen during the Great Oxidation Event (C. Scott et al. 2008). While the basic principles of Mo cycling are relatively well-understood, the specific mechanisms controlling the removal of Mo into sediments are a subject of much debate, mainly involving the roles of iron oxides and organic matter in providing adsorption sites for Mo. Furthermore, it is not known whether organic matter acts as a shuttle of Mo from the water column to the sediments or whether Mo is preferentially removed below the sediment-water interface (Dahl et al. 2016). Here are presented data on the upper section of the NW Russian Zaonega Fm organic-rich shales, which contain unprecedented Mo concentrations (up to 2000 ppm) for this age. Whole-rock and in-situ measurements of δ 98 Mo and [Mo] coupled with detailed lithological and geochemical controls allow for a thorough evaluation of the mechanisms controlling the redox-sensitive trace metal budget in Precambrian black shales. The contributions of different Mo transport mechanisms, the role of hydrothermal input, the recrystallization of sulfide species and the input of methanotrophic organic matter are considered, with important implications for global paleoredox models based off of the trace metal systematics of black shales.","tags":[],"title":"Trace metal enrichment in 1.98 Ga black shales of the Zaonega Formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaarel Mänd","Jake V.
